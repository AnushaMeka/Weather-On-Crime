# Weather-On-Crime

→ Hypothesis is that crime rate is high during summers when compared to winter months. And the other hypothesis is that crime rate in chicago has recorded all time low since 1958 after passing the law.

→ Firstly, we want to analyze the relationship crime has with environmental factors like temperature as well as temporal factors like the hour of the day, day of the week.

→ Secondly, based on the above findings, we are interested in drawing some statistical  model which explains the dynamics of crime in Chicago over the past 17 years.

→  Using the above statistical model, do some predictions about crime rates after introducing law.

→  Export the crime dataset from  https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2/data

→  Got familiar with pandas, numpy, scipy, sklearn, matplotlib, Regression analysis, curve fitting, Hypothesis Testing, Correlation Analysis.
